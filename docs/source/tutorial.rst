Tutorial
=====

This tutorial will guide you through the essential features of the MIST-Explorer application, helping you to quickly become proficient in analyzing protein expression data.

Getting Started
--------------

1. **Installation**: First, ensure you have the application installed on your system. Refer to the :doc:`install` page for detailed installation instructions.

2. **Loading Data**: Launch the application and load your microscopy image data by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Open".

Preprocessing Your Images
------------------------

Before analysis, your images often need to be preprocessed. The preprocessing tab offers essential tools for this purpose.

1. **Crop and Rotate**: Use the cropping and rotation tools to prepare your images.

2. **Image Alignment**: Align multiple image channels for accurate overlay and analysis.

3. **Cell Segmentation**: Use the StarDist segmentation to identify individual cells.

For detailed information on all preprocessing options, see the :doc:`preprocessing` page.

Visualizing Protein Expression
-----------------------------

After preprocessing your images, you can visualize and explore protein expression patterns using the View tab.

1. **Loading Data**: Load your cell segmentation image and corresponding protein expression data.

2. **Adding Layers**: Add protein channels of interest as separate visualization layers.

3. **Adjusting Display**: Use opacity, contrast, and color tinting to highlight specific features and patterns.

4. **Region Selection**: Select specific regions of interest for detailed examination.

For comprehensive information on visualization features, refer to the :doc:`view` page.
